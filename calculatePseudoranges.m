function pseudoranges = calculatePseudoranges(...

%calculatePseudoranges finds relative pseudoranges for all satellites
%listed in CHANNELLIST at the specified millisecond of the processed
%signal. The pseudoranges contain unknown receiver clock offset. It can be
%found by the least squares position search procedure.

%
%   Inputs:
%       transmitTime    - transmitting time all satellites on the list
%       rxTime          - receiver time 
%       channelList     - list of channels to be processed
%       settings        - receiver settings
%
%   Outputs:
%       pseudoranges    - relative pseudoranges to the satellites.
