SDR CODE - VLL TRACKING

Completely independent of the updated module, work has been done to implement "vector tracking" within the Matlab SDR code framework. This is based on the work of Dr. Sihao Zhao during his time as a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Boulder and was presented at the Institute of Navigation ITM 2011 meeting. For those interesting in exploring this topic, the additional/modified files to work with this from within the original SDR code can be found here.
